## Running Locally

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
````

Run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can also create new users through the `/sign-up` route.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## Going to Production

When you're ready to deploy your SaaS application to production, follow these steps:

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and deploy it.
3. Follow the Vercel deployment process, which will guide you through setting up your project.

### Add environment variables

In your Vercel project settings (or during deployment), add all the necessary environment variables. Make sure to update the values for the production environment, including:

1. `BASE_URL`: Set this to your production domain.
2. `POSTGRES_URL`: Set this to your production database URL.
3. `AUTH_SECRET`: Set this to a random string. `openssl rand -base64 32` will generate one.
